### Setting up Simplertk2b Budget Board as a Base station:
1. Update the firmware
   - Connect the Simplertk2b budget board to GNSS Survey antenna using the antenna cable given. Refer the **GPS/GNSS Antenna** section to setup the antenna in the website [User Guide: simpleRTK2B Budget](https://www.ardusimple.com/user-guide-simplertk2b-budget/#elementor-toc__heading-anchor-11).
   - Connect the the USB-B type cable to **USB GPS** port in the board and other end to the PC.
   - Open the U-center and connect the budget board with the suitable COM port and set the baud rate to 115200.
   - Download the firmware from the [FW Version 1.32](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vGNgYuJrV6BfyxmUxkQAvwy2_Sb4ySH0/view?usp=sharing).
   - Or you can find the firmware in their official website [How to configure u-blox ZED-F9P](https://www.ardusimple.com/how-to-configure-ublox-zed-f9p/#elementor-toc__heading-anchor-4) go to **Firmware version check** section download the **Version 1.32**. Extract the file in separate folder.
   - And follow the **Firmware update** section to update the firmware and cross check that the version updated correctly with the **Firmware version check** section found in the same website.

2. Loading the base station configurations on the budget board.

4. Connecting the RFD modem to the budget board to send the data over radio
   - Connect the **V Standard pin** of the RFD modem to **5V_OUT** pin of Budget board and **GND pin** of the RFD modem to **GND pin** of the Budget Board
   - Connect the IOREF pin of the Budget board to **3V3_OUT** pin so that the uart pins work on 3.3V power
   - Connect the **TX pin** of the RFD modem to the Budget board's **TX2 pin** and **RX pin** of the RFD modem to the Budget board's **RX2 pin**
   - The same is done below for the reference.

### Errors faced when setting up base station
1. If the base station is not changed to TIME or TIME/DGNSS mode
   ### Solution
   - On the top left of the U-center software select **view -> Message view**.
   - The message tab will get opened.
   - ![base station message view](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3bbc621b-69e9-4f27-9fc4-0b6de5ef5ef5)
   - In the Messages tab go to  **UBX -> NAV -> PVT** and select the column and enable it
   - ![base ubx nav pvt](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1c9f46c-c439-46c6-bd00-4da1a5285d0e)
